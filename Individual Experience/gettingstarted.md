# Intro to Git with Github Desktop


### By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Initialize a project folder as a repository.
- Track changes to files in the project.
- View the entire history of the project.
- Go back to a previous version of the project.

### What is Github Desktop?

A productivity tool that helps you

- manage projects.
- track projects history in a graphical interface.
- spend less time typing the same commands over and over.
- visualize and make meaningful commits.
- with other people!

### Adding and cloning repositories

Make a new folder for your project. Let's make it into a repository in GitHub Desktop.


### Saving and Tracking Changes

Let's make a Haiku!

In your project folder that is now a repository, make a new text file.

Note that GitHub Desktop tracks all changes to all files as you as soon as you save the file.

You can now decide how to group the changes to create meaningful commits.

Similar to saving a file, a **commit** is a tracked changed in your branch. Git makes a unique ID for each commit that tracks:

- The specific changes
- When those changes were made
- Who made the changes

When making a commit, you must include a commit message that briefly describes the changes.

### Reverting a commit

Go to History tab, right click then

### Make Changes in a Branch

- Create a branch for your work.
- Switch to that branch.
- Let's merge it back in.

### Create a Pull Request

### Changing a remote's URL
