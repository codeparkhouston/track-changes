Welcome back from the break!

# Review: Make a new repository

What we'll be doing now is getting to something I find really exciting about git and GitHub -- the way it let's us work together!  To get started, I will need to make a repository on my computer.  This is a good opportunity for us to review how we do that.  What do I do?

1. File > New Repository
1. Create Repository
1. Open our project

We now have our starting project!

# Let's make a commit

I have a poem about git for this occassion.  I'm going to put that in our project.

Now we see our changes as before.  What's next?

1. Describe our changes
1. Tell git to commit to memory or save this snapshot of our changes

# Get it online

We see we have our history of changes, just like before!  So that we can work with each other on this project, we need to put our repository online.  How do we do that?

1. Publish Repository

Cool!  Our project is online.  Let's check it out with "View on GitHub."
