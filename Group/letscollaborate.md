Welcome back from the break!

# Review: Make a new repository

What we'll be doing now is getting to something I find really exciting about git and GitHub -- the way it let's us work together!  To get started, I will need to make a repository on my computer.  This is a good opportunity for us to review how we do that.  What do I do?

1. File > New Repository
1. Create Repository
1. Open our project

We now have our starting project!

# Let's make a commit

I have a poem about git for this occassion.  I'm going to put that in our project.

Now we see our changes as before.  What's next?

1. Describe our changes
1. Tell git to commit to memory or save this snapshot of our changes

# Get it online

We see we have our history of changes, just like before!  So that we can work with each other on this project, we need to put our repository online.  How do we do that?

1. Publish Repository

Cool!  Our project is online.  Let's check it out with "View on GitHub."

# Get it on our own computers and add our own poems

The repository is not yet in your computer.  Let's get it on your computers so that we can easily start to make the changes you want.

We download the repository to our computers by doing something called "Clone Repository," to make a copy of the project and it's whole history with it.  Then, let's take some time to make a new file in the poem project, add and commit your own poems to the project.

1. File > Clone Repository
  1. Find the repository I just made on github
  1. Copy the URL by clicking on the copy button
  1. Click on the URL tab on the "Clone a Repository" popup on GitHub Desktop
  1. Choose where you want the project to go on your computer
  1. Click the "Clone" button
1. Make a new text file and write a short poem
1. Save the file in the `a-poem` folder for the repository.
1. Ask git to commit a snapshot of your changes in GitHub Desktop.

# Publish our changes

Now that git knows about your latest changes, let's publish your changes to the remote that is on GitHub.

1. Click on "Push origin"
  * Push origin sounds weird right?  We can think of it like this: when we want the changes from our computer to a computer away from us, we push the changes from us.  "Origin" is the default name for the place/web address/remote that we first download or clone the repository from.
1. !!!!! We get an alert about how we're not allowed to do this!

# Why Issues?

When we make repositories on GitHub, only people we allow to make changes to the repository can do it.  One way we can handle this problem is for me to adjust the permissions for this project so that you can make edits to this.

One of the things GitHub does really well, as we were saying is letting people work together on a project.  We often need to talk about what ideas we have for a project together, and a common place to do this on GitHub is "Issues".  What we should do before we push changes to shared project is share what it is that we see needs changing before trying to make the change so that all our teammates can know when this task is complete and/or that somebody has been thinking about it and/or allow our teammates to weigh in on this.  Let's follow this procedure and each of us make "Issues" on the GitHub website for this project online.

1. Go to the GitHub page for the project.
1. Click on the "Issues" link.
1. Click on the "New Issues" button.
1. Write why your poem needs to be a part of this project :).
  * Note: There must be a title for your issue before you can submit it!
1. Click on "Submit new issue"

Now, as I refresh up here, we see all of your Issues!  Let's take a look at one.  We see in this issue that your username is saved as well!

# Let's all be collaborators!

I will use this to add each of you as a collaborator to our cool poem project.

1. Click on "Settings."
1. Click on "Collaborators" on the left-hand side.
1. Paste each of the usernames and click "Add"

Now, we see how when we have projects we want others to be able to easily work together on, we can add each other as collaborators when we have their username!  Feel free to take a quick coffee break as I continue to add each of you :).
