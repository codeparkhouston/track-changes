# Track-Changes

This is a workshop originally developed for the [Houston Hackathon](http://houstonhackathon.com/) in Partnership with [Sketch City](http://sketchcity.org/) and [Girls Coding Club](https://www.meetup.com/Girls-Coding-Club/).

We want to introduce people to Git and Github in an accessible and easy-to-understand way.
## Planning Considerations

This is a workshop for

- **programmers** who want to learn more about version control.
- **non-programmers** who want to collaborate on projects and help track changes on their own projects.

By the end of the workshop, everyone should be able to:

- Make a local project folder on his or her own computer, convert the folder a repository to share on github.com.
- understand enough about the Git and Github workflow to begin collaborating     with others on github.com.

## Structure

We planned this workshop to be delivered over 3-4 hours.

### Intro

### Individual Experience

- what is a "repository"
- diff
- commit
- "publish"
- local folder -> github repo on the interwebs

### Collaboration Experience

### Wrap Up

- different git workflows
- Github alternatives
